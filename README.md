============

Insertion Site Determination pipeline - determine the site of insertion of transgenic sequences using next generation DNA sequencing.

This is not software per se, but a methodology and pipeline for insert site determination using NGS data and commonly available open source software.

This is under construction, i will be adding simulated genome and read files for example and testing purposes soon.
